00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
Recently, I rewatched

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,500
a few episodes

3
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,419
of Euphoria and

4
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,299
was inspired to

5
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,219
add more sparkles

6
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,139
and glitter into

7
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:05,879
my makeup. This

8
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:06,580
product that I'm

9
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,459
using is Mary

10
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:09,160
Aurora Glitz Stone

11
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,400
Highlighter from Free

12
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,140
and it's so

13
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,939
shiny and it's

14
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:12,740
so pretty. It's

15
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,500
like having very

16
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,140
dust on my

17
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:14,839
face. I feel

18
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:15,359
like I've used

19
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:15,839
it a little

20
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,579
bit too much

21
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:17,120
on my face

22
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,739
right now, but

23
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:18,280
it is so

24
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,559
pretty.
